# Invisibility_Cloak_usingOpenCv-Python
This is a Real-life Harry Porter's (Hogwarts) Invisibility Cloak that has been created using Python and Computer Vision (OpenCV)

In this project a green background video is taken with a tiger in it. and a hogwarts castle image is taken. The aim of this code is to replace the 
green background in the video by the image of hogwarts castle. So this is the Invisibility Cloak project using Python and Computer Vision (OpenCV)
